# Job-Listing-and-Managment-System
 built a backend job listing app using Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB. I implemented RESTful APIs for CRUD operations and used Spring Data MongoDB for robust database management. Custom search functionality was designed with MongoDBâ€™s aggregation framework, ensuring scalability, performance, and effective API handling.
