I developed a backend application for efficient job listing management using Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB. By implementing RESTful APIs for CRUD operations and leveraging Spring Data MongoDB, I ensured robust database operations. I designed custom search functionality using MongoDB's aggregation framework for keyword-based job searches. Emphasizing scalability and performance in API handling, I demonstrated proficiency in REST API design and MongoDB integration.
